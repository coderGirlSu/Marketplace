# Marketplace
## Purpose

As the problem of global warming worsens, and the popularity of fast fashion brands. Little attention has been paid to the impact of the shopping habits that people develop to follow trends in our living environment. Therefore, I designed this two-sided marketplace, which is based on the protection of the environment to encourage everyone to recycle their own effective resources, sell or buy their own old items, and develop shopping habits that are not wasteful, so as to protect our only and beautiful earth.
