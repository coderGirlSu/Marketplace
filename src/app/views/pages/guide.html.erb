<h1 class="guide-title">♣️ Vintage Condition Guide</h1>

<p class="guide-introduction">This is a widely used guide, but not all vintage sellers are the same, so do ask for additional information if you require clarification.

    We pride ourselves on the immacliate condition of our vintage. Any imperfections will always be clearly disclosed, and described in all vintage product listings.

    Our vintage is graded for condition, using the following categories:</p>
